# Tips & Tricks

Get more out of Claude Code with these helpful tips.

## Communication Tips

### Be Conversational
You don't need to speak in commands. Just talk naturally:
- "I'm trying to organize my photos but I'm not sure where to start"
- "This error message is confusing me, can you help?"

### Ask for Simpler Explanations
If something is confusing:
- "Can you explain that in simpler terms?"
- "Pretend I'm 10 years old, how would you explain this?"

### Request Step-by-Step
For complex tasks:
- "Walk me through this step by step"
- "Explain each step before doing it"

## Useful Commands

### Get Help
Type `/help` to see available commands.

### Clear the Screen
Type `/clear` to start fresh visually.

### Check Status
Ask "What folder am I in?" or "What files are here?" to orient yourself.

## Safety Tips

### Preview Before Changing
Ask Claude to show you what it will do before making changes:
- "Show me what files would be affected"
- "Explain what this command will do before running it"

### Backup Important Files
Before major changes:
- "Make a backup of this file first"
- "Copy this folder before we modify it"

### Undo Mistakes
If something goes wrong:
- "Undo the last change"
- "Restore the backup we made"

## Productivity Boosters

### Save Repetitive Tasks
"Create a script that does [task] so I can run it anytime"

### Create Shortcuts
"Add an alias so I can type 'notes' instead of the full command"

### Morning Routine
"Create a script that shows me the weather, my calendar, and any reminders when I start my day"

## When Things Go Wrong

### Error Messages
Copy and paste the exact error message. Claude can usually explain it and fix it.

### Unexpected Results
Describe what you expected vs. what happened:
- "I expected it to create 5 files but it only created 3"

### Starting Over
It's always okay to say:
- "Let's start over with a different approach"
- "This isn't working, what else can we try?"

## Mindset Tips

1. **There are no stupid questions** - Ask anything you're curious about
2. **Mistakes are learning** - Every error teaches you something
3. **Iterate freely** - First attempts rarely perfect; refining is normal
4. **Take breaks** - Step away if frustrated; fresh eyes help
