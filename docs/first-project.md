# Your First Project

Let's build something simple: a personal greeting script that says hello to you.

## Step 1: Create a Project Folder

First, let's make a place for your project. In Claude Code, type:

```
Create a folder called "my-first-project" in my home directory and navigate to it
```

Claude will create the folder and move into it.

## Step 2: Describe What You Want

Now, tell Claude what you want to build:

```
I want to create a simple script that:
1. Asks for my name
2. Says hello with my name
3. Tells me today's date
```

Claude will write the code for you and explain what it does.

## Step 3: Run Your Script

Claude will tell you how to run the script. It's usually something like:

```
python greeting.py
```

or

```
node greeting.js
```

## What Just Happened?

You just:
1. Created a project folder
2. Described what you wanted in plain English
3. Let Claude write the code
4. Ran your first program

You didn't need to know any programming syntax!

## Tips for Describing What You Want

**Be specific:**
- Bad: "Make something cool"
- Good: "Make a script that converts temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit"

**Break it into steps:**
- "First it should ask for input"
- "Then it should calculate the result"
- "Finally it should display the answer"

**Ask for explanations:**
- "Explain what each part of the code does"
- "Why did you choose this approach?"

## What Could Go Wrong

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| "File not found" | Make sure you're in the right folder. Ask Claude "What folder am I in?" |
| Code has errors | Tell Claude "This gave me an error: [paste the error]" |
| Not what you wanted | Be more specific about what you need. It's okay to iterate! |

## Challenge: Customize It

Try asking Claude to modify your script:
- "Add a feature that asks for my favorite color"
- "Make it say goodbye at the end"
- "Add some emoji to make it fun"
