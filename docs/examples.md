## Tips for Asking

**Be specific about what you want:**
- Instead of: "Help with photos"
- Say: "Rename my photos in the vacation-2024 folder to include the date they were taken"

**Describe the end result:**
- Instead of: "Do something with my files"
- Say: "I want all my PDFs in one folder, sorted by year"

**Ask follow-up questions:**
- "Can you make it simpler?"
- "What does that part do?"
- "Can you add [feature]?"

## Remember

- You can always ask Claude to explain what it's doing
